## üõ†Ô∏è How to Customize

All personal data is centralized in the `src/data/` directory. This makes it easy to add your own content without digging through component files.

### 1. Personal Information

-   **Page Title & Meta Description**: Open `src/app/layout.tsx` and modify the `<title>` and `<meta name="description" ... />` tags.
-   **Profile Picture**: Replace `/public/images/ankit-kumar-profile.jpg` with your own photo. You can update the path in `src/components/about/about-content.tsx`.
-   **About Me Text**: Edit the text and details in `src/components/about/about-content.tsx`.

### 2. Projects (`src/data/projects.ts`)

To update the projects section:
-   Open `src/data/projects.ts`.
-   The `projectsData` array contains objects, where each object represents a project.
-   Add, remove, or edit objects in this array.
-   **Project Images**: Place your project images in the `/public/images/` directory and update the `imageUrl` property for each project.

Example of a project object:
```ts
{
  id: 'proj-1',
  name: 'My Awesome Project',
  description: 'A brief, engaging description of what this project does and the problems it solves.',
  technologies: ['React', 'TypeScript', 'TailwindCSS'],
  imageUrl: '/images/my-project-image.png',
  sourceCodeUrl: 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo',
  liveDemoUrl: 'https://my-project-live.com', // Optional
  year: 2024,
}
```

### 3. Professional Journey (`src/data/timeline.ts`)

To update your career and education timeline:
-   Open `src/data/timeline.ts`.
-   Modify the `timelineData` array. Each object represents an event on your timeline.
-   You can change the `icon`, `type`, `date`, `title`, and `description`.

### 4. Skills (`src/data/skills.ts`)

To update your skills:
-   Open `src/data/skills.ts`.
-   Skills are grouped into categories in the `skillsData` array.
-   You can add or remove skills, change categories, and adjust icons (from `lucide-react`).
-   To make a skill stand out, set its `highlight` property to `true`.

### 5. Contact & Social Links

-   Open `src/components/contact/static-contact-info.tsx`.
-   Update the `href` attributes in the `<a>` tags for your email, LinkedIn, and GitHub profiles.

### 6. Theming & Styling

-   **Colors**: Open `src/app/globals.css`. You can change the HSL values for `--primary`, `--accent`, `--background`, etc., for both `:root` (light mode) and `.dark` (dark mode).
-   **Fonts**: Open `tailwind.config.ts`. You can change the `fontFamily` properties under `theme.extend` to use different fonts. Remember to also update the font import links in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
