- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to reflect depth of knowledge and innovation.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222), a desaturated variant of indigo, to create a professional dark theme.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF00FF), a brighter analogous color, to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short descriptions, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to provide readability.
- Use a consistent set of icons in a minimalist style to represent different sections and technologies. Icons should subtly animate on hover.
- Implement a modern, responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. The 3D canvas should be prominently integrated into the landing page.
- Incorporate smooth, subtle animations throughout the site to enhance user experience. This includes scroll-triggered animations, hover effects, and transitions.
